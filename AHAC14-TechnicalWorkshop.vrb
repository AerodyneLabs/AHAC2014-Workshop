\frametitle{Function Prototypes}
Like variables, functions must be declared before they can be used.\\
This is why handler was above main in the last example.\\
\vfill
You can declare a function prototype separate from the implementation to avoid this:
\begin{lstlisting}[numbers=none]
void handler(char in);

int main() { ... }

void handler(char in) { ... }
\end{lstlisting}
Put the prototype with the rest of your global declarations and the function where ever it fits best.
