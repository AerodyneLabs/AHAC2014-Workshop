\frametitle{Waiting}
There are three statements that can slow down execution:
\begin{lstlisting}[numbers=none]
void wait(float s);
void wait_ms(int ms);
void wait_us(int us);
\end{lstlisting}
All three will pause execution for the amount of time specified. Use these statements any time you need a controlled delay.
\begin{block}{Notice}
Wait and other block statements can have some unintended side effects. This will be demonstrated later.
\end{block}
